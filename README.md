üéØ Project Overview
This project is a Real-Time Face Recognition System that captures video through a webcam, identifies known faces from a pre-trained dataset, and displays their names on the screen. It's built using powerful Python libraries like OpenCV and face_recognition.

üì∏ How It Works (Without Code)
Webcam Initialization:
The system begins by accessing your computer‚Äôs webcam. It constantly captures frames in real time.

Frame Processing:
Each video frame is processed to detect any human faces present. For accurate recognition, the image format is converted from OpenCV's default color format (BGR) to the format required by the face recognition library (RGB).

Face Detection & Encoding:
The system scans each frame to locate faces. Once detected, it converts the visual data of each face into a face encoding ‚Äî a numerical representation of the person‚Äôs facial features.

Matching with Known Faces:
The system compares the detected face encodings with a list of pre-encoded known faces (i.e., people whose photos you've already saved and processed). If the detected face matches any of the known faces based on similarity, it identifies the person.

Annotation:
For every recognized face, the system draws a box around the face and labels it with the person's name. If the face is not recognized, it labels it as "Unknown."

Live Display:
The frame with the labeled face(s) is displayed in a window titled "Face Recognition." This continues in real-time as long as the system is running.

Exit Mechanism:
You can stop the face recognition loop by pressing the q key, after which the camera is turned off and the application window is closed.

‚úÖ Key Components
OpenCV: Used to capture and display video, and draw rectangles and text on frames.

face_recognition: Used to detect and recognize faces using machine learning.

NumPy: Used for efficient numerical operations, such as calculating distances between face encodings.

Image_Encoding Module: A custom script that contains the stored encodings and names of known people. You need to run it beforehand to prepare your face database.

üîê Security & Privacy
All processing is done locally on your computer.

No internet or cloud service is needed.

No images are saved or shared automatically.
